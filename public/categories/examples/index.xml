      <description>Introductory BlurbBecause of time, I had to remove the code itself from this HTML document. I think I learned a solid lesson about choosing a proper Hugo Theme that will be best for my purposes. I really like the persian theme but it does not appear to be good for showing .rmd chunks for translating how the ggplot was generated below.
I appreciate this lesson a great deal because I think this will be an extremely valuable way to present my CV and visualizations that I have made for lab and publications.</description>
