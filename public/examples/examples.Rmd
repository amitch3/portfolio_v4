## Introductory Blurb





Because of time, I had to remove the code itself from this HTML document. I think I learned a solid lesson about choosing a proper `Hugo Theme` that will be best for my purposes. I really like the `persian` theme but it does not appear to be good for showing `.rmd` chunks for translating how the ggplot was generated below. 

I appreciate this lesson a great deal because I think this will be an extremely valuable way to present my CV and visualizations that I have made for lab and publications. 


I'll just be sure to pick a better theme for my needs next time : ) 

## Canadian Turbine 

These data will be loaded in directly to avoid any loading errors from personal machines, and all functions will be from the tidyverse. This is the Candian Wind Turbine Data (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-10-27/readme.md) from the Tidy Tuesday R dataset. 

**The snapshot below contains the variable informaion:**

## Load the Data

This looked better without the chunk but I thought the code was appropriate for the class. I would not `include` this chunk if this was not for course review. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# loading the csv directly from the site
wind_turbine <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-10-27/wind-turbine.csv')

```

## Tidy the Data

This looked better without the chunk but I thought the code was appropriate for the class. I would not `include` this chunk if this was not for course review.  

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# make characters to factors for easier grouping
wind_turbine <- wind_turbine %>%
  mutate_if(is.character,as.factor)

#glimpse(wind_turbine) # there are almost 7000 turbines in this data, across 12 Canadian providences

# removing unwated variables
selected_wind_turbines <- wind_turbine %>%
  select(-notes,
         -longitude,
         -latitude,
         -turbine_identifier,
         -turbine_number_in_project)

# creating arbitrary but even categories
selected_wind_turbines <- selected_wind_turbines %>% 
  mutate(capacity_category = ntile(turbine_rated_capacity_k_w, 6))

# creating ratings variable

selected_wind_turbines <- selected_wind_turbines %>%
  mutate(capacity_rating = case_when(capacity_category == 1 ~ "low",
                                     capacity_category == 2 ~ "below_average",
                                     capacity_category == 3 ~ "average",
                                     capacity_category == 4 ~ "above_average",
                                     capacity_category == 5 ~ "high"))
# assigning levels to new variable -
## makes visualizaions easier laer on

selected_wind_turbines$capacity_rating <- factor(selected_wind_turbines$capacity_rating,
                                 levels = c("low",
                                            "below_average",
                                            "average",
                                            "above_average",
                                            "high"))

#view
#glimpse(selected_wind_turbines)

```


## Plotting the data

This looked better without the chunk but I thought the code was appropriate for the class. I would not `include` this chunk if this was not for course review. 

The `ggplot` colors are _loosely_ based on the uniforms the `Portland Trailblazers` were wearing on 5/11/21 when they played the Houston Rockets. 


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# plotting the data
selected_wind_turbines %>%
  filter(!capacity_rating == "NA") %>%
  filter(!province_territory %in% c("Manitoba", # removing those with low turbines
                                    "Northwest Territories",
                                    "Newfoundland and Labrador",
                                    "Yukon",
                                    "New Brunswick")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=hub_height_m,
             y=rotor_diameter_m,
             size=total_project_capacity_mw),
         alpha = .8) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color=capacity_rating)) +
  theme_dark() +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "dimgrey")) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = "black",
                                 face = "bold")) +
  guides(size = FALSE) +
  theme(legend.background = (element_rect(fill = "grey71"))) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Set3") +
  scale_size(range = c(0, 10)) +
  labs(x="Turbine Height (m)",
       y="Rotor Diameter (m)",
       color = "Ranking",
       title = "Candian Turbine Output Capacity",
       subtitle = "Relative to Turbine Height and Weight") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size=14, face="bold", colour = "black")) +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size=14, face="bold", colour = "black")) 
```
