## My Research



I am in the lab of Dr. Elinor Sullivan and co-mentored by Dr. Damien Fair at the Universtiy of Minnesota.

My research focuses on understanding the effects of the overconsumption of a high-fat diet during pregnancy. Specifically, my work is dedicated to understanding how this effects fetal neurodevelopment and social outcomes.

> _I focus on understanding how diet and obesity impact the immune response during pregnancy, and then how these changes related to offspring social outcomes._
