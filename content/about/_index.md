I am from North Georgia, and was born in City of Rome. This town of about 37,000 sits just over an hour outside of Atlanta and has many knick-knacks that pay homage to the more famous Rome in Italy. I attended the University of West Georgia where I majored in Biology and played a few years of college athletics. My GPA is not fond of my days as an athlete, and I worked in a lab at Emory University to build experience before applying to graduate school. In 2012, I moved to Atlanta to pursue my inerest in biomedical research and began volunteering at Yerkes National Primate Research Institute at Emory University. I worked for Dr. Lisa Parr for 4 years studying the effects of intranasal oxyctocin on social and attentional salience in rhesus macaques. This experience provided me the platform I needed to pursue my docorate, and ss my project was wrapping up, I began applying to graduate school across the country. I was not accepted into any schools, but flew myself out to meet with researchers at ONPRC in Portland and was extended an offer after expressing a desire to attain my PhD at OHSU. I now am a PhD candidate in the departmnet of Behavioral Neuroscience at OHSU and finishing my fouth year. I will hopefully graduate in the Fall of 2022 or by Spring of 2023.
