<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In the original lab, I was interested in showing that California wines are priced higher than Oregon Wines, but are not rated as well. My goal was to show that California wines are overpriced.</p>
<p>This information was for a general audience, particularly someone is struggling in the wine section at Fred Meyer (bc we all buy wine from Fred Meyer, right?). Example images of the lab can be found below..</p>
