<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Using the Washington Trails (<a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-11-24/readme.md" class="uri">https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-11-24/readme.md</a>) from a TidyTuesday challenge, I sought to determine if the hikes that have the highest points are the best rated.</p>
<div id="figures-from-original-labs" class="section level2">
<h2>Figures from original labs</h2>
<p>The figure below shows that the highest density of top rated hikes corresponds with higher peaks. However, it looks like once you get to a high enough peak, the trade off quickly wears off. Which makes since when you think about it as once you get above the trees line the view does not change.</p>
<p>FYI - The <em>Alpine Zone</em> marks the tree lines, and this zone varies from state to state. In Washington State, the average Tree line is 5,000 to 6,000. To me, this suggests that, if I want to narrow down the best hikes in each state quickly, I should look for the beginning of the Alpine zone within each state.</p>
<p><strong>I plan to zoom in on this <em>Apline Zone</em> and identify a few hikes (or make it interactive)</strong></p>

<h2>Figure from Lab - Top Hikes for Doggos</h2>
<p>I expanded on the analysis on finding the top hikes for dogs in Washington. I just liked this one bc dogs, I will not be expanding or editing it.</p>

<h1>Final Project: Enhancing the Colors Labs</h1>
<p>In the original assignment, I highlighted the top hikes for dogs and found that the highest density of top hikes falls between 5,000 and 6,000 feet.</p>
<p>So to expand on this, I will identify and the top 10 hikes between in this range and list them nbelow.</p>
