# Introduction 

Using the Washington Trails (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-11-24/readme.md) from a TidyTuesday challenge, I sought to determine if the hikes that have the highest points are the best rated. 

## Figures from original labs

The figure below shows that the highest density of top rated hikes corresponds with higher peaks. However, it looks like once you get to a high enough peak, the trade off quickly wears off. Which makes since when you think about it as once you get above the trees line the view does not change. 

FYI - The _Alpine Zone_ marks the tree lines, and this zone varies from state to state. In Washington State, the average Tree line is 5,000 to 6,000. To me, this suggests that, if I want to narrow down the best hikes in each state quickly, I should look for the beginning of the Alpine zone within each state.  

**I plan to zoom in on this _Apline Zone_ and identify a few hikes (or make it interactive)**

## Figure from Lab - Top Hikes for Doggos

I expanded on the analysis on finding the top hikes for dogs in Washington. I just liked this one bc dogs, I will not be expanding or editing it.

# Final Project: Enhancing the Colors Labs

In the original assignment, I highlighted the top hikes for dogs and found that the highest density of top hikes falls between 5,000 and 6,000 feet. 

So to expand on this, I will identify and the top 10 hikes between in this range and list them nbelow.
