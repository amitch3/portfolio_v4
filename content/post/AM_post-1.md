# About me


I'm from a small town in North Georgia called Rome. I attended the University of West Georgia from 2007-2011, where I came in a pre-med/student-athlete and graduate a much more humble biology major. I became interested in neuroscience via my experiences as an undergraduate research volunteer in the only Neuroscience lab at the university at the time. Shortly after graduation, I moved to Atlanta Georgia where I began as a research technician at Yerkes National Primate Research Center. I have worked with non-human primates since 2014, where I started as a technician in the lab of Dr. Lisa Parr and currently still work with primaes within teh Department of Behavioral Neuroscience here at OHSU. 

I am in the lab of and mentored by Dr. Elinor Sullivan. I am also co-mentored by Dr. Damien Fair, who is the Director of the Child Mind Institute at the Universtiy of Minnesota. I study social behavior using non-invasive measures like fMRI and behavioral testing. 

My research is focused on understanding the neurodevelopmental impact that Western-Style diet during pregnancy has on offspring behavioral outcomes. Epidemiological studies have associated increased maternal Body Mass Index with a risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Austism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in offspring. Specifically, my research places an emphasis on social behavior, and how those relationships are impacted by the alterations in fetal neurodevelopment.
