# Introduction

This post is from the MoMA lab. I found it interesting in that lab that no paintings were purchased from Africa and few were purchased from South American or Middle Eastern countries. This strikes me as a classic American bias where America makes up something that it alone is good at and forces that standard on global society. 

I personally think there should be a reinvention on what is modern art and this definition should be more inclusing of the aforementioned countries.

## Revisiting the MoMA

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```



```{r}
artworks_cleaned <- read_csv("artworks-cleaned.csv",
                             col_types = cols(artist_gender = col_factor(levels = c("Male",
                                                                                    "Female"))))


artist_by_country_cl <- artworks_cleaned %>% 
  separate(col = artist_bio,
           c("NArmv","birth_country")) 

# removing the extra row that is created with 'sep'

artist_by_country_cl <- artist_by_country_cl %>%
  dplyr::select(!NArmv)

glimpse(artist_by_country_cl)
```

## wrangling the data

```{r}
artist_by_country_cl <- artist_by_country_cl %>%
  mutate(decade_acquired = case_when(year_acquired <= 1939 ~ "Thirties",
                            year_acquired >= 1940 &
                              year_acquired <= 1949 ~ "Forties",
                            year_acquired >= 1950 &
                              year_acquired <= 1959 ~ "Fifties",
                            year_acquired >= 1960 & 
                              year_acquired <= 1969 ~ "Sixties",
                              year_acquired >= 1970 &
                            year_acquired <= 1979 ~ "Seventies",
                            year_acquired >= 1980 &
                              year_acquired <= 1989 ~ "Eighties",
                            year_acquired >= 1990 &
                              year_acquired <= 1999 ~ "Ninties",
                              year_acquired >= 2000 &
                              year_acquired <= 2009 ~ "Two_Thousands",
                            year_acquired >= 2010 ~ "2010_Present"))

# this factor will need levels

artist_by_country_cl$decade_acquired  <- factor(artist_by_country_cl$decade_acquired,
          levels = c("Thirties",
                     "Forties",
                     "Fifties",
                     "Sixties",
                     "Seventies",
                     "Eighties",
                     "Ninties",
                     "Two_Thousands",
                     "2010_Present"))
```

## Factors and birth countries 

```{r}

artist_by_country_cl <- artist_by_country_cl %>%
  mutate(continent = case_when(str_detect(birth_country, "Spanish|German|French|Italian|Danish|Dutch|British|Belgian|Swiss|Swedish|Irish|Icelandic|Norwegian") ~ "Western Europe",
                             str_detect(birth_country, "Polish|Austrian|Czech|Ukrainian|Romanian|Hungarian|Croatian") ~ "Eastern Europe",
                             str_detect(birth_country, "Israeli|Argentine|Iranian|Turkish") ~ "Middle East",
                             str_detect(birth_country, "American|Haitian|Canadian|Cuban") ~ "North America", 
                             str_detect(birth_country, "Mexican|Brazilian|Nicaraguan|Chilean|Guatemalan|Uruguayan|Peruvian|Guyanese|Bolivian|Venezuelan|Colombian") ~ "South America",
                             str_detect(birth_country, "Sudanese | Moroccan|Tanzanian|Zimbabwean|Congolese|South") ~ "Africa",
                             str_detect(birth_country, "Japanese|Korean|Indian" ) ~ "Asia", 
                             str_detect(birth_country, "Russian") ~ "Russia",
                             str_detect(birth_country, "Australian") ~ "Australia",
                             str_detect(birth_country, "NA") ~ "Other"))

# setting birth_country as factor

artist_by_country_cl$birth_country <- as.factor(artist_by_country_cl$birth_country)

# setting acquired_alive as factor

#artist_by_country_cl$acquired_alive <- as.factor(artist_by_country_cl$acquired_alive)

# setting decade_acquired as factor

artist_by_country_cl$decade_acquired <- as.factor(artist_by_country_cl$decade_acquired)

# setting continent as factor

artist_by_country_cl$continent <- as.factor(artist_by_country_cl$continent)

# glimpse the data to make sure rows are appropriate. 

glimpse(artist_by_country_cl) %>%
  head()

```

## isolating countries of interest (Africa, South America, Middle Eastern)

Lets just ID the paintings
