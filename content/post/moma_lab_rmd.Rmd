# Introduction

This post is from the MoMA (Museaum of Modern Art) lab.


In the original lab, I found it interesting in that lab that no paintings were purchased from Africa and few were purchased from South American or Middle Eastern countries. This strikes me as a classic American bias where America makes up something that it alone is good at and forces that standard on global society. 

So in this, revisit to the MoMA, I would like to identify the artist and paintings from Aftica in the MoMA

## Revisiting the MoMA

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE }
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(viridis)
library(plotly)
```



```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
artworks_cleaned <- read_csv("artworks-cleaned.csv",
                             col_types = cols(artist_gender = col_factor(levels = c("Male",
                                                                                    "Female"))))

artist_by_country_cl <- artworks_cleaned %>% 
  separate(col = artist_bio,
           c("NArmv","birth_country")) 

# removing the extra row that is created with 'sep'

artist_by_country_cl <- artist_by_country_cl %>%
  dplyr::select(!NArmv)

#glimpse(artist_by_country_cl)
```

## wrangling the data

```{r}
artist_by_country_cl <- artist_by_country_cl %>%
  mutate(decade_acquired = case_when(year_acquired <= 1939 ~ "Thirties",
                            year_acquired >= 1940 &
                              year_acquired <= 1949 ~ "Forties",
                            year_acquired >= 1950 &
                              year_acquired <= 1959 ~ "Fifties",
                            year_acquired >= 1960 & 
                              year_acquired <= 1969 ~ "Sixties",
                              year_acquired >= 1970 &
                            year_acquired <= 1979 ~ "Seventies",
                            year_acquired >= 1980 &
                              year_acquired <= 1989 ~ "Eighties",
                            year_acquired >= 1990 &
                              year_acquired <= 1999 ~ "Ninties",
                              year_acquired >= 2000 &
                              year_acquired <= 2009 ~ "Two_Thousands",
                            year_acquired >= 2010 ~ "2010_Present"))

# this factor will need levels

artist_by_country_cl$decade_acquired  <- factor(artist_by_country_cl$decade_acquired,
          levels = c("Thirties",
                     "Forties",
                     "Fifties",
                     "Sixties",
                     "Seventies",
                     "Eighties",
                     "Ninties",
                     "Two_Thousands",
                     "2010_Present"))
```

## Factors and birth countries 

```{r}

artist_by_country_cl <- artist_by_country_cl %>%
  mutate(continent = case_when(str_detect(birth_country, "Spanish|German|French|Italian|Danish|Dutch|British|Belgian|Swiss|Swedish|Irish|Icelandic|Norwegian") ~ "Western Europe",
                             str_detect(birth_country, "Polish|Austrian|Czech|Ukrainian|Romanian|Hungarian|Croatian") ~ "Eastern Europe",
                             str_detect(birth_country, "Israeli|Argentine|Iranian|Turkish") ~ "Middle East",
                             str_detect(birth_country, "American|Haitian|Canadian|Cuban") ~ "North America", 
                             str_detect(birth_country, "Mexican|Brazilian|Nicaraguan|Chilean|Guatemalan|Uruguayan|Peruvian|Guyanese|Bolivian|Venezuelan|Colombian") ~ "South America",
                             str_detect(birth_country, "Sudanese | Moroccan|Tanzanian|Zimbabwean|Congolese|South") ~ "Africa",
                             str_detect(birth_country, "Japanese|Korean|Indian" ) ~ "Asia", 
                             str_detect(birth_country, "Russian") ~ "Russia",
                             str_detect(birth_country, "Australian") ~ "Australia",
                             str_detect(birth_country, "NA") ~ "Other"))

# setting birth_country as factor

artist_by_country_cl$birth_country <- as.factor(artist_by_country_cl$birth_country)

# setting acquired_alive as factor

#artist_by_country_cl$acquired_alive <- as.factor(artist_by_country_cl$acquired_alive)

# setting decade_acquired as factor

artist_by_country_cl$decade_acquired <- as.factor(artist_by_country_cl$decade_acquired)

# setting continent as factor

artist_by_country_cl$continent <- as.factor(artist_by_country_cl$continent)

# glimpse the data to make sure rows are appropriate.

# Isolating African Paintings

Below you can see all of the paintings at the MoMA when this data was created. You can see the authors in the legend and hover over to see the title of the painting. 

```{r}

plotly::ggplotly(artist_by_country_cl %>%
  dplyr::filter(continent == "Africa") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year_created,
             y=year_acquired, 
             color=artist,
             title=title)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(size=2), 
              show.legend = FALSE) +
    labs(title="Paintings From African Artists at the Moma",
         y="Year Acquired",
         x="Year Created") +
    theme(axis.text = element_text(face="bold")) +
  #ggrepel::geom_label_repel(aes(label = title),
  #                          box.padding   = 0.85, 
  #                          point.padding = .6,
  #                          min.segment.length = Inf,
  #                          position = "identity",
  #                          segment.color = 'grey50') +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE),
  tooltip=c("artist", 
            "title",
            "year_acquired"))
```


# Examples of African Work in the MoMA

Below are some examples of artwork from African artists within the MoMA. From the limited selection detailed above. Essentially, I hope this highlights the need of MoMA to increase the amount of African artists they feature.
