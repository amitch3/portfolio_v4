# Introduction 

In the original lab, I was interested in showing that California wines are priced higher than Oregon Wines, but are not rated as well. My goal was to show that California wines are overpriced. 

This information was for a general audience, particularly someone is struggling in the wine section at Fred Meyer (bc we all buy wine from Fred Meyer, right?). Example images of the lab can be found below..


## Figures from original Lab

- California wines are more expensive but doesn't give much insight into the rating of the wine

# Reevaluating Over Priced West Coast Wines

- In the reevaluation of the data, let's make a visualization that provides more insight for the general population

- **I will also render tables at the bottom that will represent the 4th feature and materials from lab_05 about tables** 

<div class = "blue">

## Loading the Data

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE }
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
library(ggpubr)
```


```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# loading the tidytuesday data

wine_ratings <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-05-28/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv")

```

## wrangling the data

The data is already "cleaned" according to the `clean_names` function within the janitor package, so I don't have to do much below apart from assigning and selecting variables of interest for the visualization.



```{r}
# removing variables of un-interest

wine_ratings_selecvars <- wine_ratings %>%
  select(-X1, -taster_name, -taster_twitter_handle, -description)

#glimpse(wine_ratings_selecvars)


# what are unique values for original variables in wine data:
# designation has 36980 unique values
# 43 total countries included
# ~ 1230 region_1s
# ~ 16 region 2s
# ~ 425 provinces
# ~ 708 varieties of wine
# ~ 17000 wineries


# based on these numbers, lets select out wines from the selected region / coast
# I'm going only going to visualize wines from regions within California and Oregon

wine_ratings_selecvars <- wine_ratings_selecvars %>%
  mutate(coast = case_when(
    str_detect(region_2 , "Napa|Sonoma|California Other|Sierra Foothills|Napa-Sonoma") ~ "Cali",
    str_detect(region_2, "Willamette Valley|Oregon Other|Southern Oregon|Washington Other|Columbia Valley") ~ "PNW",
    str_detect(region_2, "New York Other|Finger Lakes|Long Island") ~ "NorEa",
    str_detect(region_2, "North Coast") ~ "NorCo",
    str_detect(region_2, "South Coast") ~ "SoCo",
    str_detect(region_2, "Central Coast") ~ "CenCo",
    TRUE ~ "Other"))



# note that we have no nasty wines in this data based on rankings from WineSearcher.com

wine_ratings_selecvars <- wine_ratings_selecvars %>%
  mutate(rating_class = case_when(points <= 70 ~ "Ewwuhh",
                                  points >= 71 &
                                    points <= 79 ~ "Meh",
                                  points >= 80 &
                                    points <= 84 ~ "Everyday Sipper",
                                  points >= 85 & 
                                    points <= 89 ~ "Fancy",
                                  points >= 90 &
                                    points <= 95 ~ "Very Fancy",
                                  points >= 96 &
                                    points <= 100 ~ "Top Shelf"))


# assigning levels for visualization order
wine_ratings_selecvars$rating_class  <- factor(wine_ratings_selecvars$rating_class, levels = c("Ewwuhh",
                                                          "Meh", 
                                                          "Everyday Sipper",
                                                          "Fancy",
                                                          "Very Fancy",
                                                          "Top Shelf"))
# price per point 
# something that I did not do here was divide the ratio by the average price and average rating - that may be more informative
wine_ratings_selecvars <- wine_ratings_selecvars %>%
  mutate(pp_ratio = points/price)
```

# Recalling the last lab

Remember that information from classification groups for determining  the `rating_class` were made based on information in the previous lab. 

Please visit https://winefolly.com/tips/wine-ratings-explained/ for a refresher!

Below I have remade these same categories for new visualization.

            mean_rating = mean(points,

# Tables for the figure above

**This section draws on information and challenges from Lab_05**

One thing that would be useful to know about these visualizations is the amount of wine within each group. Below, I have listed out the total amounts of wine within each group in order to provide the reader with more information about how the groups are set up. 

I found adding the table extremely beneficial because when you look at the raw numbers, it kind of looks like ratios may provide more accurate insights into which region truly has the more overpriced wines.

```{r, include=FALSE}

wine_ratings_selecvars %>%
  filter(rating_class == "Everyday Sipper") %>%
  filter(coast %in% c("PNW",
                      "Cali")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(price)) %>%
  group_by(coast) %>%
  count(everdaysipp_2)

```
